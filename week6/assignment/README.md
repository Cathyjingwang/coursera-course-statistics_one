Week 6 Assigment
==========

We now return to cognitive training. Suppose we conducted a training experiment in which subjects were randomly assigned to one of three conditions:

* Working Memory training (WM)
* Physical Exercise training (PE)
* Designed Sports training (DS)

Further assume that we measured spatial reasoning ability before and after training, using two separate measures:

* SR1 (pretraining)
* SR2 (posttraining)
